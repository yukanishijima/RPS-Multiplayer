# Rock✊ Paper🖐️ Scissors✌️

[Live](https://yukanishijima.github.io/rps-multiplayer/)

Play the classic game of rock-paper-scissors live with your friend! You can send the link to your friend (or frenemy) and wait for him/her to show up! The battle begins when his/her name is entered. 

## Site Functionality and Features

- When the 1st user enters his/her name, he/she’ll be assigned as player 1. The user who enters his/her name next will be assigned as player 2. 

- When a 3rd user opens the page and enters his/her name, a sorry message will be shown as the game is for 2 players. 

- Each player picks either rock, paper, or scissors, which will be stored in Firebase. The choice will be shown only on that player’s page. Once both players have made their choice, the game will reveal both player’s choices and the result of the game on both player’s pages. 

- The game will track each player’s wins and losses using Firebase.

- The chat feature allows users to chat while playing. Upon user input, the data will be stored into Firebase and retrieved to be shown on the page. 

- The game is fully responsive for mobile and laptop.
